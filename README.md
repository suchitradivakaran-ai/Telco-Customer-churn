## Key Observations & Insights
# 1. Churn is heavily concentrated in the early customer lifecycle
Analysis by tenure shows that churn is most severe within the first six months of service, with more than half of customers (≈53%) churning during this period. This indicates that early lifecycle experience, onboarding effectiveness, and expectation setting play a critical role in determining long-term retention. As tenure increases, churn rates decline steadily, suggesting that customers who successfully pass the initial engagement phase are significantly more likely to remain loyal.

# 2. Mid-tenure customers continue to face retention risk
While churn decreases after the initial six months, customers in the 7–24 month tenure range still exhibit elevated churn rates (≈29–36%). This suggests that churn is not limited to onboarding alone but may also be influenced by factors such as billing friction, perceived value erosion, or contract-related dissatisfaction during the mid-lifecycle stage.

# 3. Long-tenure customers demonstrate strong retention behavior
Customers with tenure exceeding 25 months show a markedly lower churn rate (≈14%), indicating strong customer stickiness once long-term usage is established. This highlights the importance of strategies that help customers transition successfully from early engagement to long-term commitment.

# 4. Churned customers pay higher monthly charges but generate lower lifetime value
Comparative analysis reveals that churned customers have higher average monthly charges than retained customers, yet their significantly shorter tenure results in lower total revenue contribution. This suggests a pricing–value mismatch, where customers with higher monthly costs may be more sensitive to perceived value or service quality, leading to early disengagement despite higher upfront revenue.

# 5. Contract structure is a dominant driver of churn
Contract type emerges as one of the strongest predictors of churn. Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit extremely high churn rates (≈43%), while those on one-year and two-year contracts show substantially lower churn. This indicates that customer commitment level and contract stability are critical levers in improving retention outcomes.

# 6. Retention improves significantly with increased commitment and tenure
The combined findings across tenure, engagement, pricing, and contract type suggest that retention improves as customers move toward longer-term commitment. Customers who adopt longer contracts not only churn less but also contribute higher lifetime value, reinforcing the importance of strategies that encourage early commitment and sustained engagement.

# 7. Early intervention presents the highest opportunity for churn reduction
Given the concentration of churn in early tenure and among flexible contract users, the greatest opportunity for impact lies in early lifecycle interventions. Targeted onboarding, pricing transparency, and proactive engagement during the first few months can significantly reduce churn and improve downstream revenue performance.
